# Multi-Language Casino Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the my multilanguage Casino Number Guessing Game repository! My repository contains implementations of a casino number guessing game in multiple programming languages including Python, C++, C#, and C.

## Description
The casino number guessing game is a simple game where the player tries to guess a number between 1 and 10. If the player guesses the correct number, they win 10 times their bet; otherwise, they lose their bet. The game continues until the player decides to quit or runs out of money.

## Languages Used
- Python
- C++
- C#
- C
